    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>
      The calculator relies on data collected by the Minnesota Department of
      Transportation and publicly available at:
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="http://www.dot.state.mn.us/roadway/data/index.html"
        >http://www.dot.state.mn.us/roadway/data/index.html</a
      >. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The data provide estimates of road mileage and annual VMT by county for seven
      functional classifications of roads. Functional classifications define the type of
      service provided by a road, for example an interstate, freeway, or
      expressway allows for higher speeds and will accommodate more vehicles
      per hour compared to an arterial road, which will have traffic signals
      and lower speeds. At the far extreme are local roads with low speed
      limits that serve final destinations, such as residential and local
      commercial areas. Interstates, freeways, expressways and principal arterials are also combined into a "major roads" category. 
      This was done since sometimes reclassifications of road types are done, and combining these road types provides a better estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data for vehicle-miles of travel (VMT) is not separated by urban and rural roads, therefore urban and rural data were combined by road category.  Lane mileage data is
      available.
    </p>
    <p>
      Road classifications available in the data are listed in the table. There are 87 counties in Minnesota. The calculator includes both county data and combined based on 
      metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).  Some MSAs include counties in Wisconsin and North Dakota; these were not included in the MSA totals.
      Fargo, Grand Forks, and LaCrosse-Onalaska MSAs are not included as they contain only one county in Minnesota. The calculator also includes a combination of the 
      Mankato-North Mankato MSA with a neighboring county, Waseca County, as major roads crossing the MSA enter Waseca County.
      
      The MSA combinations included are as follows:
      <div class="indent">
      
      <p><strong>Duluth:</strong> Carlton, St. Louis, Douglas</p>
      <p><strong>Mankato-North Mankato:</strong> Blue Earth, Nicollet</p>
      <p><strong>Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington:</strong> Anoka, Carver, Chisago, Dakota, Hennepin, Isanti, Le Sueur, Mille Lacs, Ramsey, Scott, Sherburne, Sibley, Washington, Wright</p>
      <p><strong>Rochester:</strong> Dodge, Fillmore, Olmsted, Wabasha</p>
      <p><strong>St. Cloud:</strong> Benton, Stearns</p>
      </div>

     
      <p>
      Our first year of data is 2016 and we will update to the latest year
      available. Data for prior years is inconsistent and has not been included. Caution should be used when analyzing data and interpreting
      results for 2020 and 2021 due to changes in travel patterns due to the
      COVID pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>We also include an estimate of CO2 emissions. This is estimated based on the average transportation CO2e emissions per mile for the entire state which is 484 grams/mile. 
        Data on total transportation emissions was from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dot.state.mn.us/measures/greenhouse-gas-emissions.html"
        >Minnesota Department of Transportation, Performance Measure Dasbboard</a> for transportation emissions. We assumed an average of 40 million metric tons CO2 equivalent in total. 
        This was divided by total VMT in 2023.</p>
      <p>
      Elasticity assumptions in the calculator are shown in the table for
      each road classification. In general, the empirical evidence suggests
      that larger higher speed roads have a larger elasticity. We have
      included a range and the calculator output provides a range of
      estimates for induced VMT. Given the potential range of estimates and
      variation in how VMT may be affected, we have included a
      “back-calculator” which allows the estimation of an “implied
      elasticity” based on forecast growth in VMT associated with a capacity
      expansion. This can be thought of as the elasticity implied by any
      forecasts of travel done by the state or a local agency promoting the
      capacity expansion. The assumption often made, is that there is no
      change in VMT attributable to the expansion, despite the evidence for
      induced travel. The user of the calculator is thus able to assess
      whether estimates made in forecasts are reasonable.

  <h2>Calculations</h2>
    <p>
      The elasticities shown above are used to determine how a change in
      lane miles will lead to a change in annual VMT. The formula for estimating
      the induced VMT is:
    </p>
    <p>
      <math display="block">
        <semantics>
          <mrow>
            <mrow>
              <msub>
                <mi mathvariant="italic">Induced</mi>
                <mi mathvariant="italic">VMT</mi>
              </msub>
              <mo stretchy="false">=</mo>
              <mi>ε</mi>
            </mrow>
            <mi>∙</mi>
            <mfrac>
              <mi mathvariant="italic">NewLM</mi>
              <mi mathvariant="italic">LM</mi>
            </mfrac>
            <mi>∙</mi>
            <mi mathvariant="italic">VMT</mi>
          </mrow>
        </semantics>
      </math>
    </p>
    <p>
      Where:
      <ul>
        <li>ε = elasticity</li>
        <li>NewLM = the newly added lane mileage for the county</li>
        <li>LM = the current lane mileage in the county</li>
        <li>VMT = the current vehicle-miles of travel in the county</li>
        <li>
          Induced<sub>VMT</sub> = the vehicle miles of travel induced by the
          increase in lane miles
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      The back-calculation simply reverses this equation but requires the
      user to input both “new lane miles” and the “forecasted annual increase in
      VMT”. The output is an implicit elasticity, that is, the elasticity
      that is implied by the forecast increase in VMT.
